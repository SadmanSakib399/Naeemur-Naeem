# 🌑 Naeemur Naeem — Personal Website (Unfinished)

This was a personal website I started building for my friend **Naeemur Naeem**.  
It was meant to be a simple **portfolio + profile site**, but I only managed to finish  
around **two pages** before leaving it incomplete.  

Even though it’s unfinished, I’m keeping it here because it represents  
one of my **first attempts at making a site for someone else** rather than myself.

## 📖 About
- Dark, minimalist design with bold typography.  
- Planned sections: **About, Portfolio, Contact, Footer**.  
- Contains an **intro page** with name + background image.  
- Includes a short **About Me section** with text and profile photo.  

---

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to design a site **for another person’s needs/style**.  
- Using backgrounds, hero text, and layout to create presence.  
- Structuring multiple pages in a small project.  
- That finishing projects can be harder than starting them 😅.  

---

## ⚡ Highlights
- A bold landing page with Naeem’s name front and center.  
- A clean “About Me” section with photo + short intro.  
- My first experience trying to **capture someone else’s personality** in code.

## 💡 Reflections
I never really finished this site — only two pages are done —  
but it still taught me a lot about design and the importance of **commitment**.  

I see it as a **half-finished sketch**: not perfect, but still worth keeping  
as a memory of my early experiments with web design.

## 🔮 Next Steps
Maybe one day I’ll revisit this idea and **fully build it out**.  
For now, it stays here as a reminder that not every project needs to be perfect.  
Sometimes, even incomplete projects have their own story.
